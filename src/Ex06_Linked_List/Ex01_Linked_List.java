        //✅ 1. What is a Linked List?
     //A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers.
        //Each node contains:
        //•	Data (value)
        //•	Reference (pointer) to the next node
    //Unlike arrays:
        //•	Memory is not contiguous
        //•	Size is dynamic
        //•	Insertion/Deletion is efficient (no shifting)

//2. ✅ Types of Linked Lists
//Type	Description
//Singly Linked List	Each node has data + a pointer to the next node only
//Doubly Linked List	Each node has data + a pointer to next & previous nodes
//Circular Linked List	The last node points back to the head (can be singly or doubly circular)
